# VoiceCommands
A little module that allows speech output. Might be extended in the future.

# Example
Using Out-Voice is simple enough. Just pipe stuff to it.
```powershell  
"PowerShell is awesome!" | Out-Voice
```  

Optionally you can select a gender. Out-Voice defaults to female.  
```powershell
"3...2...1... Engange!" | Out-Voice -Gender Male
```
